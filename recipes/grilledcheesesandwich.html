            Sometimes the best meal are the ones you can make the quickest and easiest.
            When time is of the essence, a grilled cheese is the perfect speedy sandwich.
            Couple it with a nice bowl of roasted tomato soup if time permits and you'll have
            a lunch or dinner that will more than satisfy.
